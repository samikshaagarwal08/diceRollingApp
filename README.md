Dice Roller App

This is a simple Flutter app that simulates rolling a dice. The app generates a random dice face each time the "Roll Dice" button is pressed. It also features a visually appealing user interface with gradient backgrounds and card-like elements.

Features:

1. Random Dice Roll: Generates a random number (1 to 6) and displays the corresponding dice face.
2. Interactive UI: Includes a button to roll the dice and updates the UI dynamically.
3. Modern Design: Gradient background, rounded corners, shadows, and a responsive layout.
